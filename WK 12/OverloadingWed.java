
//Objective 1 - Write the program class & main method structure


	//Objective 5 start - Write an overloaded method for each data type from Objective 2 
		// that contains a print statement that outputs:
		// “Input type: " + [DATATYPE] "\n Value: + [ARGVALUE] + "\n"
	

		//Objective 6 - Write an overloaded method printInput() that multiplies 
		// the int and double from Objective 2 and returns the result



//Objective 2 - Declare and initialize a variable of each 
//type with data of your choice: char, int, double, boolean, String 


//Objective 3 start - Write a for loop to iterate 5 times


//Objective 4 - Write an if statement using the for loop variable 
//to call each overloaded method once


//Objective 7 - Outside the for loop & if statement, write a print statement 
		// that calls the overloaded method printInput() from Objective 6 and 
		// prints its return value to 3 decimal places
